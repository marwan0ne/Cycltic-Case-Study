In 2016, Cyclistic launched a successful bike-share offering. Since
then, the program has grown to a fleet of \emph{5,824} bicycles that are
geotracked and locked into a network of \emph{692} stations across
Chicago. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any
other station in the system anytime. \emph{Cyclistic} classifies it
users into two categories: 1. \emph{Casual Riders}: Customer who
purchase single ride or full-day passes. 2. \emph{Members}: Customer who
purchase \emph{annual membership}.

analyst, can help Cyclistic achieve them. \emph{Cyclistic executive
team}: The notoriously detail-oriented executive team will decide
whether to approve the recommended marketing program. \# Busnies task
\emph{Three questions will guide the future marketing program:} 1. How
do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently? 2.
Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships? 3. How can
Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become
members? \emph{this analysis aims to answer the first question}:How do
annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?
