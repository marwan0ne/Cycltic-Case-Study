    "# Recommendations\n",
    "1. The Chicago warm season should be the focus of  the marketing strategy, since it's the high season for the bike riders <br/>\n",
    "2. Put more ads in the docked_bikes area for the casual members.<br/>\n",
    "3. Highlight in the marketing campaign that the casual users would spend 51.8% less time at each ride if they subscribed to the annual program.<br/>\n",
    "4. Send motivational messages at the rush hours to the annual members to encourage them to ride the bike.<br/>\n",
    "5. We may build reward system for the riders it should be based on rides streak if the rider used the bike everyday for some period of time like a month he will get a discount on the next annual subscription. That would encourage the annual members to use our service more regularly.<br/>"
